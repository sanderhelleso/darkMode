# darkMode
darkMode qucikly allows you to change an entire HTML page and its elements to a dark theme with a single trigger, then revert back once triggered again.

## Usage
Simply pull this repository and include the script on any HTML page. Enter the ID of the element you want to use as a trigger and you are good to go.

If you want to use the script combined with other functionality, copy darkMode, clearDarkMode and the color variables into your own script, and initialize the trigger in your onload function.
